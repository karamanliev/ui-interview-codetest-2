# UI Code Exam

Welcome to the UI Code Exam! This repository contains a full-stack application scaffold with a pre-built GraphQL server and a starter React frontend. Your task is to implement the user interface according to the provided Figma design.

## What You're Building

![Dashboard Screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ddc6496-9227-4efa-ac27-3749776316f7)

This is a pnpm monorepo containing:

- **Server** (`/server`): A fully functional Apollo GraphQL server with mock data. This server provides all the data you'll need and is ready to use. No backend work is required.
- **Client** (`/client`): A React + TypeScript + Vite starter application with Apollo Client configured. This is where you'll build the UI.

The GraphQL server exposes the following queries:

- `user` - Get the current user information and their spaces
- `recommendations(spaceId)` - Get recommendations for a space
- `metrics(spaceId)` - Get metrics for a space
- `teams(spaceId)` - Get teams for a space
- `tickets(spaceId)` - Get tickets for a space
- `reports(spaceId)` - Get reports for a space

All data types are fully typed in GraphQL schema files located in `/server/src/schema/`.

## Requirements

<!-- You will fill this section out -->

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher recommended)
- **pnpm** (v9 or higher)

If you don't have pnpm installed, you can install it via:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies from the root directory:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This will install dependencies for both the server and client workspaces.

### Running the Development Servers

From the root directory, run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This command will start both the GraphQL server and the Vite development server concurrently:

- **GraphQL Server**: http://localhost:4000
- **GraphQL Playground**: http://localhost:4000/graphql
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173 (default Vite port)

You can also run the servers individually:

```bash
# Run only the server
cd server && pnpm dev

# Run only the client
cd client && pnpm dev
```

### Working with GraphQL

#### Apollo Studio (GraphQL Playground)

Navigate to http://localhost:4000/graphql to explore the GraphQL schema and test queries in Apollo Studio.

#### Type Generation

This project uses GraphQL Code Generator to automatically generate TypeScript types from your GraphQL queries and the server schema. The client is pre-configured with type generation.

**When you add new GraphQL queries or mutations**, you must regenerate the TypeScript types:

From the root directory:

```bash
pnpm codegen
```

Or from the client directory:

```bash
cd client && pnpm codegen
```

Generated types will be available in `/client/src/types/`.

**Pro tip**: You can run type generation in watch mode while developing:

```bash
cd client && pnpm codegen:watch
```

#### Creating GraphQL Queries

1. Create your query file in `/client/src/graphql/queries/` or `/client/src/graphql/mutations/`
2. Define your query using the `graphql` template literal (see existing examples in `/client/src/graphql/queries/`)
3. Run `pnpm codegen` from the root to generate types
4. Import and use your typed query in your React components

Example query structure:

```typescript
import { graphql } from "@/types";

export const GET_TICKETS = graphql(`
  query GetTickets($spaceId: ID!) {
    tickets(spaceId: $spaceId) {
      id
      title
      health
      progress
      createdAt
      ownerId
    }
  }
`);
```

### Tech Stack

**Frontend:**

- React 19
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Apollo Client
- Material-UI (MUI)
- Emotion (CSS-in-JS)

**Backend:**

- Apollo Server
- GraphQL
- TypeScript

### Testing

Run tests for both client and server:

```bash
pnpm test
```

Or run tests for a specific workspace:

```bash
cd server && pnpm test
cd client && pnpm test
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Explore the Schema**: Visit http://localhost:4000/graphql to understand the available data structure
2. **Use Type Generation**: Always regenerate types after creating new queries to get full TypeScript support
3. **Check the Examples**: Look at the existing `GET_USER` query for a working example of the query pattern
4. **Focus on the UI**: The backend is complete, spend your time crafting a great user experience
